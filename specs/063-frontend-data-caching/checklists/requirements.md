# Specification Quality Checklist: Frontend Data Caching

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: PASS

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is ready for the next phase.

### Key Strengths

1. Clear problem statement with identified root causes
2. Five user stories covering core functionality with P1/P2 prioritization
3. Measurable success criteria with specific targets (80% improvement, 100ms latency)
4. Well-defined edge cases for robustness
5. Clear scope boundaries with explicit "Out of Scope" section

### Notes

- Items marked complete indicate spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`
- No clarification questions were needed as requirements are well-defined
