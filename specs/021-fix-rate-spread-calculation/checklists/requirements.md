# Specification Quality Checklist: 修正費率差異計算的時間基準一致性

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **All quality checks passed**

### Highlights:
- Specification is complete with no clarification markers needed
- All 8 functional requirements are clear and testable
- 7 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- 3 prioritized user stories cover all primary flows
- Edge cases comprehensively identified
- Dependencies, assumptions, and out-of-scope items clearly documented

### Ready for Next Phase:
✅ Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

- Specification quality is excellent
- No updates required before proceeding to planning phase
- The problem, solution, and success criteria are all clearly defined
